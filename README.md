**LINUX/WINDOWS SERVERS WORK**
* This repository only supports Sourcemod 1.11 and up.

A Competitive L4D1 Versus Configuration. Based upon the L4D2 [Acemod V4 Release](http://imgur.com/a/8Ptck)、L4D2 [Zonemod](https://github.com/SirPlease/L4D2-Competitive-Rework)、L4D1 [rotoblin2](https://github.com/raziEiL/rotoblin2). Roto-AZMod's focus is not only to make setting things up a lot easier for Server but also to make more difficult challenges and add some features such as Uzi more powerful, Hunting Rifle avaible, increase max damage pounce, more Tank hp and more map changes. The whole environment is similar to l4d2, but don't worry, the core is still around l4d1 gameplay.

### Server Install ###
* Clean Servers:
  * A clean [L4D1 Dedicated Server](https://github.com/fbef0102/Sourcemod-Server/tree/main/L4D1#how-to-download-l4d1-dedicated-server-files)
  * Make sure your server is stopped.
  * Delete left4dead/addons folder on your server (to make sure you have a clean slate).
  * Go [Releases Page](https://github.com/fbef0102/Rotoblin-AZMod/releases) and download **l4d1_Roto-AZMod.zip**
* Requirements:
  * Install "Windows Server files" or "Linux Server files" (depending on the operating system of your server), this contains Sourcemod, Metamod, Stripper, Tickrate, and other extensions

  * At this step, you already setup Server's base for configs, so you can finally start the server.

### Server Install Optional ###
* [Auto_restart](https://github.com/fbef0102/L4D1_2-Plugins/tree/master/linux_auto_restart) is a useful plugin, restart server as soon as all human players are disconnected. Recommended for **LINUX**

* [Top 5 Skeet](https://github.com/fbef0102/Game-Private_Plugin/tree/main/L4D_%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6/Hunter_Hunter/l4d_skeet_database_remake) records players' skeets, and save to server-side Database.

### Server Anti Cheat ###
* [Sourcemod_Anti-Cheat-SMAC](https://github.com/fbef0102/SMAC): Server-side sourceMod Anti-Cheat plugin, I modfidy some codes to make them compatible with Roto-AZMod.
* [Little-Anti-Cheat](https://github.com/fbef0102/Little-Anti-Cheat): Free and open source anti-cheat for source games. Helpful in dealing with cheaters such as aimbot, bunnyhop, aimlock.
* [EFFECT DETAIL anti-cheat](https://github.com/fbef0102/Game-Private_Plugin/tree/main/L4D_%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6/Player_%E7%8E%A9%E5%AE%B6/l4d_cpu_level): Spectate player if OPTIONS->Video->EFFECT DETAIL is low
  * Because some map objects, tank rocks, items.... can be invisible in player's monitor if EFFECT DETAIL is low
* [l4d_hackers_block](https://github.com/fbef0102/L4D1_2-Plugins/tree/master/l4d_hackers_block): Block hackers using some exploit to crash server
> **Developer Comment:** I highly recommend to install all, you would be surprised that they are still many cheaters in l4d1 even after 15 years.

### Server Admins! ###
**Warning: If you try to use the plugins which are included in this package in other configs, plugins may not work correctly
as they're designed around Roto-AZMod and are likely to be unstable in other configs or general usage.**

* Admin simplicity:
  * [Be Adm](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Adding_Admins_(SourceMod)#Quick_Start): -left4dead/addons/sourcemod/configs/admins_simple.ini
  * MatchMod: -left4dead/addons/sourcemod/configs/matchmodes.txt
  * Advertisements: -left4dead/addons/sourcemod/configs/advertisements.txt
  * HostName: -left4dead/addons/sourcemod/configs/hostname/server_hostname.txt
  * Mapcyclelist: -left4dead/addons/sourcemod/data/sm_l4dvs_mapchanger.txt、sm_l4dco_mapchanger.txt
  * CustomMapVote: -left4dead/addons/sourcemod/configs/VoteCustomCampaigns.txt
  * Save player chat (and team chat) to a file: -left4dead/addons/sourcemod/logs/chat/
  * Control Map Info: -left4dead/addons/sourcemod/data/mapinfo.txt
  * Rcon passeword、rates、maxplayers、tags、group: -left4dead/cfg/server.cfg、server_rates.cfg、server_startup.cfg
  * [Translations](/Developer%26Commands/Translation%20Language.txt): -left4dead/addons/sourcemod/translations/Roto2-AZ_mod.phrases.txt
  * If you have a prefered edition of a Plugin, you are able to simply replace the file in sourcemod/plugins folder.
    * do not overwrite any plugin that's existed.
  * To make it easy for personal configuration for certain plugins, there's an added "server_custom_convars.cfg" in the left4dead/cfg/Reloadables folder.
    * Keep in mind that this is a shared cfg, server excutes it after every mode loaded and map change, so it'll only contain shared cvars.
    * very useful for Admins wanting to load 1v1~5v5 supported plugins on top of the Configs.
	  - *For people who don't like "extra pills on the map"*: ```rotoblin_health_style 3```
	  - *For people who don't like "Who will be the tank"*: ```tank_control_disable 1```
	  - *For people who don't like "Pill Extra Health Bonus"*: ```l4d_score_healthbounus_pill 0```

* Admin Tips:
  * bequiet.smx is a very useful plugin to keep chat clean, if you decide to load it in other configs, make sure it's loaded before other plugins.
    * Block name change announcement
    * Block server convars change announcement
    * Block chat with '!' or '/'
  * l4d_versus_specListener3.0.smx comes with a "Spec-Listening Feature", even if sv_alltalk 0, spectators can still see in-game players teamchat and hear their mic voice. To close this feature, use ```sm_hear```.
  * TickRateFixes now also fixes Slow Doors and Pistol Scripts, useful for use with other configs.
    * Make sure you're not loading l4dpistoldelay if you're using this Plugin.
    * Make sure you don't have any adjustments to prop_rotating and prop_rotating_checkpoint speeds in your cfg/stripper folder.
    * The cvar controlling the door speed is "tick_door_speed" and is set to 1.3 by default.
  * Specrates.smx is a useful plugin to reduce server load causes by spectators.
    * This will send less updates to Spectators whilst maintaining a pleasant viewing experience.
  * When player connects or disconnected, it would print the message to everyone, only adms can see steamid .
  * All4Dead.smx allows administrators to influence what the AI director does without sv_cheats. it's a menu system which is attached to the sm_admin menu
  * votes3.smx makes All players can not call a valve vote (esc->vote). Remeber if player wants to call a vote, use ```sm_votes``` instead!!
  * Adm type ```sm_slots <#>``` to forcechange server slots
  * [All Admin commands](/Developer%26Commands/Roto-AZMod%20Adm%20Commands.cfg)
  * [Everyone commands](/Developer%26Commands/Roto-AZMod%20Everyone%20Commands.cfg)
  * Sever Startup default Mode is "Pub VS", there are some limits in pub mode
    * forces survivors and infected to spectate if they're AFK after certain time.
    * team Switch is not allowed after game starts for at least 60 seconds. (To close this feature, set l4d_teamswitch_during_game_seconds_block 0)
    * shoot teammate = shoot yourself.
    * anti open saferoom door and prevent players from leaving safe area within some seconds.
    > **Developer Comment:** make some changes to prevent idiots and griefers, so let newbies enjoy and play :D

  > **Developer Comment:** As we've noticed in L4D1, the Uzis were completely nothing and shotguns were taking over everything. In the release of Roto-AZMod, I want to make the Uzi more attractiv, which result into the Uzi having more advantages. And there can be a sniper in a team, this Hunting Rifle is nerfed a lot as you can see rate of fire is very slow. Peope can choose thier desired weapons. Each performs one's own best part in a team.

### Score Calculation(!health/!bonus) ###
* ( AD + HB + PILLS ) x Alive x Map 
   * AD = Average distance
   * HB = Health Bonus, (PermanentHealth/2) + (TemporaryHealth/4)
   * PILLS = 15 Health Bonus per pill
   * Alive = Number of players that survived
   * Map = That level's score multiplier
   > **Developer Comment:** This effectively gives you a higher reward for holding onto pills, we encourage player to search pills. And restore level's score multiplier as we consider it's unfair that short map and long map have the same maximum score
